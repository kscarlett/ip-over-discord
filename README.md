# IP over Discord

### What

A TUN interface that base64 encodes packet data and forwards it over Discord.

### Why

Because I can >:D

### Can I use this in production?

Sure, if you really want to. I don't think Discord would be too happy though (or that the performance/stability would be very nice).
